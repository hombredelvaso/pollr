    '<p class="join-cust-2">The online application is open from May through November each year with a deadline of November 1st. The application then goes through an eligibility review and then it is sent to a first round of reviewers. In January, the applications are sent to selection committees to select the semi-finalists to be interviewed via video-conferencing. From these interviews, the finalists are selected. For the Executive Branch placements, the finalists then come to Washington, DC in April to be interviewed by the actual federal agencies. In May and June the offers are made and in June and July the placements are finalized. For Congressional Fellows, the finalists come to Washington in September for an orientation and then interviews with the host offices for placement.</p>'+

    '<hr>'+
    '<br>'+
    '<p class="join-cust-2">Excellent scientist, engineer or health professional as it is important to bring that level of rigor to the federal government. Applicants must show leadership ability both with large and small groups. And they must show a commitment to public service and an interest in public policy (although they do not necessarily need public policy experience). And finally, they should be able to demonstrate how their skills would be able to contribute to public policy issues. They also must be an excellent communicator since so much of this role is as a translator to broad and non-scientific audiences.</p>'+

    '<hr>'+
    '<br>'+
    '<p class="join-cust-2">Scientists need to be proactive in the way they communicate with policy makers and need to communicate in a less technical way and in a way that matters to the policy makers. They need to think about how their science relates to that topic, so that they can frame their message in a way that is relevant to policy makers that is also clear and concise and without jargon.</p>'+

    '<hr>'+
    '<br>'+
    '<p class="join-cust-2">When working with the media, scientists should be particularly proactive. Plan your messages out ahead of time. Start with the bottom line—the facts that are most important to have in the article. Be sure to speak clearly, precisely and be patient since the journalist may be taking notes or waiting for you to say more.</p>'+

    '<hr>'+
    '<br>'+
    '<p class="join-cust-2">Scientists are trained to communicate with other scientists in a very effective and efficient way. However when speaking with public audiences, an opposite approach is usually best. Speak as though you were speaking with a friend about something unrelated to science, in order to communicate in a way that matters to them. Using jargon and relying on precise technical terms is also a common pitfall and should be avoided and instead, translate those terms into clear and precise descriptions.</p>'+

    '<hr>'+
    '<br>'+
    '<p class="join-cust-2">The internet and social media offer many ways for scientists to communicate with public audiences. The internet can increase the pace of conversation about scientific topics and may seem to broaden the communication about the topic. But it is important for scientists to consider the audiences they are reaching. Scientists need to use social media to reach outside of the audiences with whom they are currently connecting, to find other audiences with whom they might want to connect. Be deliberate and proactive about where they are, the channels of communication they are using when connecting with those people in social media.</p>'+

    '<hr>'+
    '<br>'+
    '<p class="join-cust-2">Find out who your member of congress is and where you might meet them, either in their district or DC office. Contact them to introduce yourself and see about setting up a meeting with them or their staff member. Then research what their priorities are—what committees do they sit on and what issues are important to them? Figure out how the issues you want to discuss relate to their issues and priorities. Figure out how best to articulate your message as to how what you do is valuable to them and the country. Be sure to prepare for your meeting by articulating what you want to say and condensing it.</p>'+

    '<br>'+
    '<p class="join-cust-2">Universities and institutions like AAAS deal constantly with government relations and monitor the legislative cycle and what congress is doing.  They are therefore an excellent resource for finding out the best way you can make your case heard and for contacting the right point of contact. They also have numerous resources where you can get additional background and current information regarding the topic you wish to discuss.</p>'+

    '<hr>'+
    '<br>'+
    '<p class="join-cust-2">Follow-up is very important. For example, if your focus is on a particular bill in congress, keep abreast of the progress of that bill, and what your congress person or their staff has done in response to your meeting. By following up with them, they will know that you are not a one-time visitor, but are monitoring this as it is very important to you.</p>'+
